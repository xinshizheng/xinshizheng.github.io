title: Setup Ubuntu 18.04 for Data Science
categories: Linux
---

This article is mostly a series of code snippets that I have used to set up my own laptop for development. As the title suggests, I use Ubuntu 18.04. The overall goal is to easily install and set up a collection of data science / engineering tools that I personally prefer to use for data science project development. I will assume a non-root user with sudo privileges on a new Ubuntu 18.04.

## Git
### Installation

The easiest way to install Git is to use Ubuntu's default repository using apt commands. The following two lines will first update your local package idnex and then install the default version of Git found there:

```zsh
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install git
```

Pay attention to the instructions through the process as you may need to confirm installations of Git and some dependent packages. The successful installation can be verified by:

```zsh
$ git --version
```

In my case the terminal prints:

```zsh
git version 2.17.1
```

### Configuration

Git should be properly configured after installation. This is done by linking your name and E-mail address (They should be the ones you set up with your github account if you wish to see proper commit ownership on Github) to it:

```zsh
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "you@email.com"
```

The result can be verified by:

```zsh
$ git config --list
```


## Vim & VSCode

## Oh my zsh

## Python

## Docker

## Postgres
